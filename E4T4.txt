1. What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet-facing attack surface of the web application instance.
- Add AWS Shield as protection against DDOS attacks.
- Add Web Application Firewall (WAF) to prevent common security exploits against your application.
- Add API Gateway for controlling API calls and AWS Certificate Manager for encrypted API traffic.
- Move the Web Service Instance to the Private Subnet 1 and add a NAT gateway for internet software updates and downloads.
- Integrate a federated IAM for user authentication and create / assign IAM roles for authorisation.

2. Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent 
the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

No, as moving the S3 bucket to a private VPC endpoint would only prevent traffic coming from outside the VPC.
As you have insecure IAM permissions for the S3 bucket, unauthorised access can still occur.

3. Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No, as encryption only occurs on new objects in the S3 bucket after being enabled.

4. The changes you made above were done through the console or CLI; describe the outcome if the original cloud formation templates
are applied to this environment?

The templates would overwrite all of the changes made to the environment made to this point.
