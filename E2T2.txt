=====
Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be 
related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project. 

Provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

=====

1. CIS.4.1	Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22

	Rationale:
	
		Removing unfettered connectivity to remote console services, such as SSH, reduces a
		server's exposure to risk.
	
	Remediation steps:
		
		- Ensure that administrators currently relying on an existing ingress 
		from 0.0.0.0/0 have access to ports 22 through another security group.
		
		- Remove Inbound Rule above from AttackInstanceSG and 
		WebAppSG Security Groups
		
2. CIS.2.1	Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions

	Rationale:
		
		Enables auditing and supports any future cybersecurity forensic investigations.

	Remediation steps:
	
		- Enable CloudTrail across all regions with logs stored in S3.
		
3. CIS.2.4	Ensure CloudTrail trails are integrated with CloudWatch Logs

	Rationale:
		
		Sending CloudTrail logs to CloudWatch Logs will facilitate real-time and historic activity
		logging based on user, API, resource, and IP address, and provides opportunity to establish
		alarms and notifications for anomalous or sensitivity account activity.

	Remediation steps:
	
		- Configure each CloudTrail with a new or existing CloudWatch Log Group.
		
		- Configure IAM Role and Policy that will deliver CloudTrail events to CloudWatch Logs.
		
4. Enable CloudWatch log metric filters and alarms

	- CIS.3.1 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for unauthorized API calls	
	- CIS.3.10 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for security group changes	
	- CIS.3.13 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for route table changes	
	- CIS.3.14 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for VPC changes	
	- CIS.3.4 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for IAM policy changes	
	- CIS.3.5 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for CloudTrail configuration changes	
	- CIS.3.8 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for S3 bucket policy changes	
	- CIS.3.9 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for AWS Config configuration changes	
	- CIS.2.3 Ensure the S3 bucket used to store CloudTrail logs is not publicly accessible	
	- CIS.2.6 Ensure S3 bucket access logging is enabled on the CloudTrail S3 bucket
