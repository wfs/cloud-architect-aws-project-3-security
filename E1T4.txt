Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to 
upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 
obvious poor practices as it relates to security. 
List these 2 practices, and a justification for your choices, 
in the text file named E1T4.txt.

1. WebAppSG: This web service's security group permits ingress traffic 
    from any IP address on the internet to all ports which exposes 
    this server to attacks.
    It also allows all egress traffic to any IP address.

2. RecipeWebServiceInstance: The Recipe Web Service Instance is located
    in a public subnet instead of being moved to a private subnet.

3. S3BucketRecipesSecret: These 'secrets' are not encrypted allowing 
    them to be read by anyone with account access.

4. InstanceRole and InstanceProfileRole: This IAM Role + ProfileRole 
    used by the web service has full access to S3 actions, which 
    does not conform to the security principle of least privilege.
